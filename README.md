# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

    It is a single page project coded to improve skills on Sass and React
    It was fully coded in 8 hours time

    I used the theme from https://thecodude.com/demo/tf/future/index.html
